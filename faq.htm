          Before e-mailing <A 
            href="mailto:support@dosprn.com">support</A>, be sure that you're using the latest available version
          of DOSPRN and your problem is not described in this FAQ or <a href="readme.htm">DOSPRN
          documentation</a>.

          <br>
          </b>DOSPRN is fully-functional shareware. You can <a href="download.htm">download</a>
          the self-installation module and test all DOSPRN features at no
          charge. You do not need to have a license KEY for this purpose. You should
          try DOSPRN and be
          convinced that DOSPRN can solve your problem with DOS printing before <a href="order.htm">purchasing</a>.

          <p><a name="15"></a><b>The text printed on paper includes letters
          and signs that should not be there. Why ?</b><br>
          <br>
          Your DOS program most likely uses some special <b>Sequences</b> to manage printing. 
          DOSPRN can emulate some of them. You should select an appropriate
          Sequences palette. In the DOSPRN
          properties window, press the &quot;Sequences&quot; button to open the &quot;Sequences&quot; listbox.<br>
          <br>
          See more about <a href="sequences.htm">DOSPRN sequences support</a>.
          If you're sure you have 1selected the proper sequences palette, yet your documents include
          unusual characters, then e-mail <A 
            href="mailto:support@dosprn.com">support</A>.
          </p>
        <li>
          <p><a name="16"></a><b>My document has been printed incorrectly. Can I give you
          this document to be tested ?</b><br>
          <br>
          Open the DOSPRN properties window and <i><b>uncheck</b></i> the &quot;AutoPrint&quot;
          option. With this, DOSPRN will capture the DOS program printing tasks but will 
	  not print them.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
 	  The detained tasks will be located in a DOSPRN temporary file (%USERPROFILE%\prnspl1
          usually). This file also should be sent via e-mail to our <A 
            href="mailto:support@dosprn.com">support</A>. If you need to continue the 
	  printing job later, you can select the &quot;AutoPrint&quot; option again.

          <p><a name="17"></a><b>I can print a text file with the DOSPRN &quot;Print
          file&quot; option but reports from my DOS program are not captured .
          Why ?<br>
          <br>
          </b>Some DOS programs try to manage the printer directly through hardware
          input/output ports, without using DOS functions. DOSPRN can't capture
          reports from such programs. If your DOS application can save reports as
          a text file, proceed as follow: clear the DOSPRN &quot;Capture port&quot;
          option and set up the &quot;Job filename&quot; properties to match
          your report file names. Don't forget that temporary job file will be removed by DOSPRN
          after printing.

          <p><a name="1"></a><b>What is the registration and why is it necessary?<br>
          <br>
          </b>DOSPRN is a <i>shareware</i> product. You can try it to get the 
	  idea of how it functions, check it's compatibility with yours DOS programs and decide
          if you need it. You can print up to one hundred documents for this
          purpose. At the point that you determine the usability of DOSPRN, you should either purchase DOSPRN or 
	  uninstall it.
          </p>
        <li>
          <p><a name="2"></a><b>What is the registration code and registration key?<br>
          <br>
          </b>DOSPRN key protection is based on providing an individual license to every user. 
	  After installation on your computer, DOSPRN generates registration <b>CODE</b>s that 
	  consider your hardware and software configuration.<br>
          <br>
          Open the DOSPRN properties window and press the &quot;Registration&quot;
          button. In the &quot;Code&quot; field you can see one of the generated
          codes.<br>
          <br>
          When purchasing, you should enter the registration code of your DOSPRN copy.
          Our support will send an unlock key at the specified e-mail address. After
          you paste your unlock <b>KEY</b> in the corresponding field of the registration
          window, your DOSPRN license will be activated.

         Is anything wrong?</b><br>
          <br>
          No, this is correct. This is a part of the DOSPRN key protection system.
          You can send any code that you find there.
          </p>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="4"></a>If I send you my registration code, shall I leave the 
	  registration window open and my computer switched on until I receive my unlock key?<br>
          <br>
          </b>You shouldn't do so. You can send us any of the <b>CODE</b>s that you saw 
	  in the Registration window and close DOSPRN or shutdown your computer. The unlock
          <b>KEY</b> you will receive will activate your license. Please take care to make 
	  no mistakes when you type in the <b>CODE</b> or <b>KEY</b>. 
	  Use 'copy and paste' to avoid typos.

          DOSPRN still shows the need to register window every time I print my report.<br>
          <br>
          </b>When you type your registration KEY, DOSPRN accepts ANY key with a<br>

          DOS program reports.<br>
          <br>
          There are some ways that this situation can occur:<br>
          1) You made a&nbsp; mistake when sent to me your registration CODE or
          when you typed in your license KEY<br>
          2) You have taken the registration CODE from a computer different from
          the one on which you are now trying
          to register DOSPRN.<br>
          <br>
          Please, open the DOSPRN registration window now and resend the CODE to me.<br>
          <br>
        <li>
          <a name="5"></a><b>Shall I buy a new license if I need to reinstall my operating system?</b><br>
          <br>
          No, any purchased license is given &quot;forever&quot;. If you reinstall the operating system,
	  or if you install a new version of your OS on the same computer, you can use the received registration 
	  <b>KEY</b> for DOSPRN activation.<br>
          <br>
          If you make an essential upgrade of your computer or install 
	  DOSPRN on a new computer, then you should contact <A href="mailto:support@dosprn.com">support</A> and 
	  get a new <b>KEY </b>free-of-charge.

          <p><a name="10"></a><b>Why are not all fonts available for printing from DOSPRN?<br>
          <br>
          </b>DOSPRN uses Unicode for simultaneous display of symbols pertaining to different codepages. This is why your national letters and characters can print correctly only with fonts that support Unicode. We recommend that you use only monospaced fonts because many DOS-programs use tabulation for text alignment or columns, and
          only monospaced fonts can display such documents properly. We
          recommend that you use <i>Courier New</i> or <i>Lucida Console</i> fonts.

          <p><a name="21"></a><b>I have a computer with 2 printers. Can your program handle both?<br>
          <br>
          </b>Yes, DOSPRN can print on any printing devices whose drivers have<br>
          been installed on your computer.<br>
          <br>
          But at the present DOSPRN can print on only one printing device simultaneously. You
          can select the current printer in the DOSPRN properties window ("Printer" area,
          "Select" button).<br>
          <br>
          We plan to develop support for simultaneously printing on difference printers. If you have 
          ideas as to how this should work, please <a href="mailto:support@dosprn.com?Subject=DOSPRN%20multiple%20printers%20support">mail
          to us</a> your ideas.

        <p><a name="13"></a><b>What is a sequence ?<br>
        <br>
        </b>Sequences are special sets of the ASCII-codes that are used to manage information layout being displayed by a printing device. For example, all Epson-compatible&nbsp;
        printers support sequences of the ESC-P2 standard (i.e. Esc-sequences).<br>
        <br>
        Sequences enable changing size and pitch of the printed symbols, horizontal and vertical density of printing, and allow printing of simple graphic objects.<br>
        <br>
        By default, DOSPRN supports its own sequences palette, but it can emulate
        the more important ones and it often uses the resources of ESC-P2 standard. See more <a href="sequences.htm">about
        ESC sequences</a>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><b><a name="14"></a>My DOS-program works with Epson-compatible printers and it can print texts with letters of different sizes and pitches. I have tried DOSPRN, but all letters look the same on paper.<br>
        <br>
        </b> DOSPRN uses its own palette of sequences by default. To switch to printing with ESC-P2 palette support, you should open the
        DOSPRN properties window, select &quot;Main&quot; tab and press
        &quot;Sequences&quot;. Then, select &quot;Epson
        Matrix&quot; from the drop-down menu and press &quot;Apply&quot;.</p>
